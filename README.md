# dotfiles
Configuration dotfiles mostly for my ArchLinux pc, vimrc is also used with my workplace Windows pc.

## .vimrc
This file was copied from [JeffreyWay](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834), and added/removed some stuff. I use  [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) colorscheme on pretty much everything, inclugind MSDOS command and VisualStudio.

## .Xresources
Configuration of RXVT-Unicode mainly, again, using [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) color theme.

### ToDo
Modify script to copy fonts and vim files into their folders inside home
