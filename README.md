# dotfiles
Configuration dotfiles mostly for my ArchLinux pc, vimrc is also used with my workplace Windows pc.

## .vimrc
This file was copied from [JeffreyWay](https://gist.github.com/JeffreyWay/6753834), and added/removed some stuff. I used [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) colorscheme on pretty much everything, inclugind MSDOS command and VisualStudio.

### ToDo
This repo was created from my workplace, need to add all my dotfiles from ArchLinux
